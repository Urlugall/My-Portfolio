9:T5f8,<b>[Goal]</b> The impetus for the creation of such a program was the move to France and the beginning of the study of French. Faced with the system of articles for nouns similar to German, and remembering how poorly they are remembered, my friends and I decided to study programs for studying this direction. As it turned out, the market was quite small even compared to the German one. And seeing that most French learners don't use such programs for various reasons, we wanted to take our brainchild out into the world.<br/>Thus, one friend helped to find and collect a list of the most popular nouns, the second helped with the translation. The third one I taught programming in the Unity environment, so with her help, the process went even a little faster. Also, we gave it to the French teacher to test it and add some corrections.<br/><b>[Solution]</b> The process itself is as simple as a language learning app might sound. Of course, not without nuances, but everything is standard: the preparation of the color palette and user interface in Photoshop. Further, the connection of data tables with words and translation for a couple of main languages. Ultimately, creating a list in the application itself, programming the word selection system, settings, and even little things. Of course, it is not planned to leave this project at this stage, because when you see so many interested people, an interesting and simple development with improving design skills and an excellent 'picture' for a resume, it's hard to stop.2:["$","div",null,{"className":"main-container","children":[null,["$","$L6",null,{}],["$","$L7",null,{}],["$","div",null,{"className":"page-content container mx-auto p-4","children":["$","$L8",null,{"items":[{"id":1,"tags":["Unity","Firebase","Figma","Photoshop","Google Cloud","Google PLay Console","UI/UX","C#","API","Android","iOS"],"imageSrc":["/projects/images/Lalel1.png","/projects/images/Lalel2.png"],"title":"Lalel - Mobile App for French learning","link":{"text":"GooglePlay","href":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.vixiv.lalel"},"date":"December 2022","responsibilities":"- Published on <b>Google Play</b> using Google Play Console, an educational mobile app for teaching <b>French articles</b> with Unity engine, which was tested from <b>10+ different countries</b>.<br/>- Crafted <b>interactive quizzes</b> with Figma and Photoshop to enhance user engagement.<br/>- Integrated <b>text-to-speech</b>, <b>speech recognition</b>, and <b>translation features</b> with Google Cloud APIs and plugins, to enable users to practice their <b>pronunciation</b> and <b>comprehension</b> skills.

The rest of the magnets are just docked and should transmit information about the newly connected magnets.
